Dataset Upload</strong><br/>Upload a CSV file containing protein sequences and multiple experimental values for each sequence.<br/><br/><strong>Step 2.

Predictor Training</strong><br/>Train a prediction model for each experimental value.<br/><br/><strong>Step 4. Screening</strong><br/>Evaluate the generated sequences using predicted values and likelihoods from the generative model, and filter them based on thresholds.<br/><br/><strong>Step 5. Generative Model Fine-tuning</strong><br/>Fine-tune the generative model using the high-quality sequences selected through screening.<br/><br/>By repeating these steps, the system aims to generate optimal protein sequences tailored to your objectives.",
